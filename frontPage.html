Characterized by intricately carved wooden windows, latticed balconies, and red brick walls, the exterior exudes an old-world charm that transports you back to the era of royal palaces and ancient temples. The sloping tiled roofs, a signature feature of traditional Nepali buildings, add to the authenticity, ensuring that The Star Hotel stands as a beacon of Nepal's architectural tradition.

The lobby features high ceilings supported by wooden beams and columns, adorned with detailed carvings of deities and symbols that hold cultural significance.
